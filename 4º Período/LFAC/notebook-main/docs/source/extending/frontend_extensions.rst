===========================
Custom front-end extensions
===========================

This describes the basic steps to write a TypeScript extension for the Jupyter
notebook front-end. This allows you to customize the behaviour of the various
pages like the dashboard, the notebook, or the text editor.

Starting with Notebook v7, front-end extensions for the notebook can be developed
as prebuilt JupyterLab extensions.

This means Notebook v7 is able to reuse many of the existing extensions from the JupyterLab ecosystem as is.

If you would like to develop a prebuilt extension for Notebook v7, check out:
