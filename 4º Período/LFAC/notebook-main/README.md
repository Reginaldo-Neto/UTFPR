The Jupyter notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
computing.

### Notice

The Jupyter Notebook project is currently undertaking a transition to a more modern code base built from the ground-up using JupyterLab components and extensions.

There is new stream of work which was submitted and then accepted as a Jupyter Enhancement Proposal (JEP) as part of the next version (v7): https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html

There is also a plan to continue maintaining Notebook v6 with bug and security fixes only, to ease the transition to Notebook v7: https://github.com/jupyter/notebook-team-compass/issues/5#issuecomment-1085254000

#### Notebook v7

The next major version of Notebook will be based on:

- JupyterLab components for the frontend
- Jupyter Server for the Python server

This represents a significant change to the `jupyter/notebook` code base.

To learn more about Notebook v7: https://jupyter.org/enhancement-proposals/79-notebook-v7/notebook-v7.html

#### Classic Notebook v6

Maintainance and security-related issues are now being addressed in the [`6.4.x`](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/tree/6.4.x) branch.

A `6.5.x` branch will be soon created and will depend on [`nbclassic`](https://github.com/jupyter/nbclassic) for the HTML/JavaScript/CSS assets.

New features and continuous improvement is now focused on Notebook v7 (see section above).

If you have an open pull request with a new feature or if you were planning to open one, we encourage switching over to the Jupyter Server and JupyterLab architecture, and distribute it as a server extension and / or JupyterLab prebuilt extension. That way your new feature will also be compatible with the new Notebook v7.

### Jupyter notebook, the language-agnostic evolution of IPython notebook

Jupyter notebook is a language-agnostic HTML notebook application for
Project Jupyter. In 2015, Jupyter notebook was released as a part of
The Big Split™ of the IPython codebase. IPython 3 was the last major monolithic
release containing both language-agnostic code, such as the _IPython notebook_,
and language specific code, such as the _IPython kernel for Python_. As
computing spans across many languages, Project Jupyter will continue to develop the
language-agnostic **Jupyter notebook** in this repo and with the help of the
community develop language specific kernels which are found in their own
discrete repos.

## Installation

You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

Launch with:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

### Running in a remote installation

You need some configuration before starting Jupyter notebook remotely. See [Running a notebook server](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html).

## Development Installation

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to set up a local development installation.

## Contributing

If you are interested in contributing to the project, see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
